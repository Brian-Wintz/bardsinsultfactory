# Bard's Insult Factory
This is a tongue in cheek program that I use to test out implementing for different UI's.  The program is implemented for android using Android Studio.  When the program starts it randomly assembles Shakespearan words from 3 different lists to create a random insult.  It implements a button click event to generate a new random insult.
